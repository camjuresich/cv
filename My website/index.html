    <p>I want to pursue what is important to me. Right now I believe that God should be a much more important part of my life.
      With that in mind, I want to still become sucessful in my career and relationships and feel that I am excelling.
      I don't always believe that I am on the right track and I generally don't want to spend my time doing things I percieve as
      as difficult. In the end, I usually end up hurting the ones around me. So I want to take a stand and talk about things
      that are <strong>important</strong>to me. I want to play ukulele more often. I want to still be able to play video games.
      I want to be smart and continue to learn so I can become self-sufficient. I don't however, desire to be self-reliant.
      I want to make youtube videos and make money off what I produce. I want to have creative space and make enough money to
      make those around me comfortable. I believe I have the time to do all these things I want to do I just need to keep better
      track of what is going on and tell people and be up front about my problems. </p></td>
